## Setup

1. Execute the **MySQL** database query in the file named *ocelot.sql*.
In the file *ocelot.sql* you will find some users credentials that will allow you to login. You will have to create a **SECRET KEY** which is going to encrypt every user's password. Use this **SECRET KEY** to encrypt these users passwords.
2. Setup the **.env file in the server**, you can use the **.env-example** file by renaming it to **.env**.
    - Assign the **SECRET KEY** for user's passwords to **SECRET_DB_ENCRYPT**.
    - Assign the value that you want to **SECRET TOKEN**. This value is going to be used to encrypt the authentication's token.
    - Assign a MySQL username to **DB_USER** and their password to **SECRET_DB_PASSWORD**.  Remember to give all privileges in the database to this user. If it's necessary, also assign the correct hostname to **DB_HOST**
3. Install client dependencies:
```
cd client
```
```
npm install
```
Execute client's proyect: ```npm run serve```

4. Install server dependencies:
```
cd server
```
```
npm install
```
Execute server's proyect: ```npm run dev```

User CREDENTIALS:
- Username: IudexSoren | Password: Iudex400@Soren
- Username: Soren | Password: Iudex400@Soren

## About

The purpose of this proyect is only to practice the use of the Vue library in the client or front-end and the environment Node Js in the server or back-end.
Lorian Tech was meant to be an online shop about computer components like ExtremeTech's page

Actually, the proyect is not finished yet, but it has functionalities like:

- Register a user (Only administrators with respective privileges can do this)
- Login user
- Recover an account by using a random code generated by the system
- Activated, deactivate and block users
- Add or remove user privileges
- Add or remove a profile image

And some other functionalities...


I feel very proud of what I've done till now because I always wanted to build a system with authentication and authorization using roles and permissions. This is by far, **the best proyect** I've done, at least until now February, 4th 2022.


The whole proyect is divided by other two proyects: client and server.

## Client

The client was build using Vue 3.2, Vuex, Vue Router, Axios, Tailwind and some other libraries. The interface is **totally responsive** and I tried my best with the user experience.

## Server

The server was build using Node Js with Express, Socket IO, Joi for validations, JSON Web Token and other libraries. I tried my best to build a secure server.

### Database

The database used was MySQL
